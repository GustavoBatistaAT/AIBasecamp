# Basecamp AI Assistant

A Claude Desktop integration that lets Artistic Tile team members interact with Basecamp using natural language — read projects, manage todos, post messages, check schedules, and more — all from within Claude Desktop.

Built by Artistic Tile IT

## How It Works

```
Claude Desktop  ──MCP──►  Python MCP Server  ──subprocess──►  Basecamp CLI  ──OAuth──►  Basecamp API
```

- **Claude Desktop** handles the conversation and AI reasoning
- **Python MCP Server** (`app/basecamp_mcp_server.py`) exposes 30 Basecamp tools via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Basecamp CLI** (official, by 37signals) handles all API calls and OAuth token storage
- Authentication is stored securely in the Windows Credential Store — no API keys in config files

## Features

| Category | What you can ask |
|---|---|
| Projects | List all projects, drill down into any project |
| Todos | View, create, complete, and bulk-create tasks |
| Messages | Read message boards, post and reply |
| Schedule | View upcoming events and milestones |
| People | Look up team members and profiles |
| Cards | Browse Kanban card tables |
| Docs & Files | Browse the Vault and document lists |
| Reports | Overdue items, assigned tasks, schedule reports |
| Search | Full-text search across all of Basecamp |
| Notifications | Check your notification inbox |

Claude presents results in clean tables, drills down two levels into projects, and can act as a project advisor — flagging overdue items, suggesting task assignments, and recommending focus areas.

## Installation

Run the installer — it handles everything automatically:

```
BasecampMCP_Setup.exe
```

**What the installer does:**
1. Detects CPU architecture (x64 or ARM64) and downloads the correct native binaries
2. Detects whether Python 3.12 and Claude Desktop are already installed (prompts to install only if missing)
3. Installs the Basecamp CLI to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\BasecampMCP\`
4. Installs the `mcp` Python package
5. Patches `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` to register the MCP server
6. Sets the Artistic Tile Basecamp account ID globally
7. Restarts Claude Desktop automatically

After the installer finishes, a checkbox offers to open the browser for Basecamp login (required on first run).

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | 10 / 11 | x64 or ARM64 |
| Claude Desktop | Latest | Installer can download it |
| Python | 3.10+ | Installer can download 3.12 |
| Internet connection | — | Required for Basecamp auth |

### ARM64 (Copilot+ PCs, Surface Pro X, etc.)

The installer runs on ARM64 Windows without any changes. On ARM64 machines it automatically downloads native ARM64 builds of:
- **Basecamp CLI** — from the official 37signals GitHub release
- **Python 3.12** — ARM64 build from python.org

Claude Desktop is x64-only (no ARM64 build from Anthropic) but runs transparently via Windows emulation.

> **Compiling the installer** requires [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php). Run:
> ```
> iscc.exe installer\setup.iss
> ```
> Output: `installer\Output\BasecampMCP_Setup.exe`

---

## First-Time Setup After Install

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Confirm the Basecamp MCP server is active:
   - Go to **File → Settings → Developer** — `basecamp` should appear with a blue status
   
   To disconnect: click **Remove** next to `basecamp` in that same screen, then restart Claude Desktop.
3. Run Basecamp authentication if not done during install:
   - Open PowerShell and run: `basecamp auth login`
   - Authorize in the browser that opens
4. In Claude Desktop, open or create a **Project** and paste the contents of `docs/system-prompt.md` as the project instructions

## MCP Tools Reference

The server exposes 30 tools. Claude routes to them automatically based on natural language.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|

| `show_project` | Project details |
| `project_overview` | Combined drill-down: details + todos + messages |
| `list_todolists` | Todo lists within a project |
| `list_todos` | Todos (filter by status/assignee) |
| `show_todo` | Single todo details |
| `create_todo` | Create a single todo |
| `create_todos_bulk` | Create multiple todos at once |
| `complete_todo` | Mark a todo complete |
| `list_messages` | Message board posts |
| `read_message` | Full message with comments |
| `post_message` | Post a new message |

| `list_schedule_entries` | Upcoming schedule entries |
| `show_schedule_entry` | Single event details |
| `list_people` | Team members |
| `my_profile` | Current user profile |
| `my_assignments` | Your assigned todos |
| `list_cards` | Kanban card table |
| `show_card` | Single card details |
| `browse_vault` | Vault / file storage |
| `list_docs` | Documents list |
| `list_notifications` | Notification inbox |
| `reports_overdue` | Overdue todos report |
| `reports_assigned` | Assigned todos report |
| `reports_schedule` | Schedule report |
| `search` | Full-text search |
| `check_auth` | Verify Basecamp authentication |

## Security Notes

- OAuth tokens are stored in the **Windows Credential Store** (managed by the Basecamp CLI) — never written to disk in plaintext
- The MCP server uses `subprocess.run()` with list arguments — no shell interpolation, immune to command injection
- No Basecamp API keys or secrets are stored anywhere in this repository
- `basecamp.exe` and compiled installer output are excluded from git via `.gitignore`

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Basecamp not showing in File → Settings → Developer | Restart Claude Desktop; check `claude_desktop_config.json` has `mcpServers.basecamp` |
| `basecamp: command not found` | Verify `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\BasecampMCP\basecamp.exe` exists |
| Auth error / token expired | Run `basecamp auth login` in PowerShell |
| Malformed config warning from CLI | Re-run the installer Configure phase or check `~/.config/basecamp/config.json` for BOM |
| Python not found | Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and on PATH |
